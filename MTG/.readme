This is a little mini project script that helps out with MTG on Tabletop Simulator

Decklists can be imported as text from the below websites
https://tappedout.net/

Problem is it also includes edition tags etc that TabletopSimulator doesn't play nice with

This script parses out those additional tags so you can import the deck with no issue and get started playing asap!

Inlucdes:
Ease of use with drag and drop into script functionality
Input validation
exception handling
